# ModelBuildingProject

# Introduction
I made this project as apart of training machine learning in AI approach club. I chose a Dataset that represents the survived passengers from a ship crash.
# Objective
This project aimed to:
•	See the factors that will enhance the model training.
•	show the difference among many ML algorithms.
•	discover which algorithm is more accurate.

# About the dataset
The sample Dataset includes data for the Sales of multiple products sold by the store along with subsequent information related to geography, Product categories, and subcategories, sales, and profits, segmentation amongst the consumers, etc. This sample Dataset presents a common use case, from which you could gather useful insights from the Sales data in order to improve the Marketing and Sales strategies. you can learn about various operations and elements using this sample Dataset and come up with better strategies to improve and grow the business more.
DataSet columns:
Survived: Survival status of the passenger (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).
class: Passenger class
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
n_siblings_spouses: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the ship
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the ship
Fare: Fare $ paid by the passenger.
Embarked: Port of embarkation
Alone: y if the passenger has no siblings or parents on the ship

# Steps
1.	Importing Libraries
2.	Access to csv file in my drive files
3.	Read the Dataset and check the head
4.	DATA Cleaning
5.	check information
6.	data labeling
7.	find correlation matrix 
8.	splitting the data to training and testing data
9.	training the model.
10.	evaluate the model performance 
11.	improve the performance 
12.	show the accuracy for each training algorithm
13.	use many algorithms:
    - logistic regression
    - K-NN
    - SVM
    - Random Forest
    - Decision Tree


# Conclusion
This project is an simple application of what I have learned about ML fundamentals.
For each step within the project implementation, I support the codes with comments and description. 

**I am glad to receive any comments or notes.**
